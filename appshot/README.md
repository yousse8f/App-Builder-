# Screenshots Android / iOS

Generate professional app screenshots for App Store and Google Play. Drop in a screenshot, pick a style
pack, write the copy, get PNGs at every required device size.

A visual editor **plus** a CLI any coding agent can drive. Both use the same render
engine (`src/core/render.js`), so what you see in the editor is byte-for-byte what gets
exported.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm link            # makes `appshot` available everywhere
```

Rendering runs through Chromium. If you do not already have a Playwright browser
cached, install one:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Or point at any Chrome/Chromium you already have with `APPSHOT_CHROME=/path/to/chrome`.

## Usage

```bash
appshot editor                  # visual editor → http://localhost:4321
appshot --help                  # every command
```

```bash
appshot new my-app --app "My App" --bg indigo
appshot add my-app ~/Desktop/shots/*.png
appshot pack my-app panorama-flow
appshot set my-app --frames all --titles "Track it all|Set and forget|See your progress"
appshot render my-app --open
```

Output lands in `out/<project>/<device>/01-headline.png` at the exact pixel size the
store expects (iPhone 6.9" 1290×2796, iPad 13" 2064×2752, Android Phone 1080×1920, Android Tablet 1600×2560 …).

## What is in it

- **18 style packs** — one click styles the whole set: background, typography, device
  settings and a template for every frame, so no frame is left half-finished.
- **21 templates** — text-top, hero, tilt, duo, trio, full-bleed, split, corner, peek…
- **Continuous sets** — panorama and storyboard packs treat the whole set as one wide
  composition: the background flows across frames and some devices span two
  screenshots.
- **17 background presets** plus solid / linear / radial / mesh / image /
  blurred-screenshot, with dots, grid, diagonal or noise on top, and a shape layer
  (blocks, blobs, waves, circles) drawn across the entire set.
- **Pure-CSS device frames** — Dynamic Island, notch, iPad, Android punch-hole, Android tablet. No
  external assets, sharp at any scale.
- **Frames with no device** — a poster template, two poster packs and a *no device*
  switch for every other template, for covers and closing cards built from a picture,
  a headline and layers.
- **Layers** — stack images, text and emoji on any frame. Drag to move, round handle
  to rotate, square one to resize, ⌘C/⌘V to copy a layer onto another frame or onto
  every frame at once.
- **Linked frames** — two frames sharing one screenshot, with the device split down
  the seam so half lands on each. Fill one and both fill; delete one and both go.
- **Panoramic backgrounds** — stretch a single wide image, gradient or mesh across the
  whole set, each frame showing its own slice.
- **Localization** — add a language and it appears as a new row on the board. Only
  text and screenshots vary per language; the layout is shared. Exports go to
  `out/<project>/<locale>/<device>/`.
- **Per-device screenshots** — give iPad, Android Phone, or Android Tablet their own images instead of cropping a phone shot.
- **14 fonts** (Google Fonts) plus a system-font fallback.
- Resolution-independent units (percentages of canvas width), so one setting looks the
  same on every device.

## Editor

**Grid** is the default view: a blueprint board with one row per language and one
column per frame, so you can see and edit the whole set, in every language, at once.
**Edit** gives you a single large canvas instead. The **This frame / All frames**
switch decides whether an edit lands on one frame or the whole project.

Add a screen and you get an empty frame with a placeholder — lay the set out first
and fill the images in later, by clicking a placeholder or dropping a file on it.
Click the screenshot or the background of the selected frame to swap it, and drag the
headline or any layer straight on the canvas.

## Driving it from a coding agent

There is no AI dependency here — it is a plain Node CLI, so anything that can run shell
commands works: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Aider, or a script of your own.

`AGENTS.md` documents the CLI so an agent can do batch edits without hand-editing JSON.
`CLAUDE.md` just points at it, so both conventions resolve to the same file.

```
cd appshot-studio && claude      # or: codex, cursor-agent, …
> rewrite all the headlines and export just the iPhone sizes
```

The editor also has a **Claude Code** button that shows the equivalent commands for the
open project, ready to copy — they are ordinary shell commands, so paste them anywhere.
